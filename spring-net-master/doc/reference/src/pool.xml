  <title>Object Pooling</title>

  <sect1 xml:id="pool-introduction">
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The Spring.Pool namespace contains a generic API for implementing
    pools of objects. Object pooling is a well known technique to minimize the
    creation of objects that can take a significant amount of time. Common
    examples are to create a pool of database connections such that each
    request to the database can reuse an existing connection instead of
    creating one per client request. Threads are also another common candidate
    for pooling in order to increase responsiveness of an application to
    multiple concurrent client requests.</para>

    <para>.NET contains support for object pooling in these common scenarios.
    Support for database connection pools is directly supported by ADO.NET
    data providers as a configuration option. Similarly, thread pooling is
    supported via the System.ThreadPool class. Support for pooling of other
    objects can be done using the CLR managed API to COM+ found in the
    System.EnterpriseServices namespace.</para>

    <para>Despite this built-in support there are scenarios where you would
    like to use alternative pool implementations. This may be because the
    default implementations, such as System.ThreadPool, do not meet your
    requirements. (For a discussion on advanced ThreadPool usage see <ulink
    url="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/threads/smartthreadpool.aspx"> Smart Thread
    Pool</ulink> by Ami Bar.) Alternatively, you may want to pool classes that
    do not inherit from
    <literal>System.EnterpriseServices.ServicedComponent</literal>. Instead of
    making changes to the object model to meet this inheritance requirement,
    Spring .NET provides similar support for pooling, but for any object, by
    using AOP proxies and a generic pool API for managing object
    instances.</para>

    <para>Note, that if you are concerned only with applying pooling to an
    existing object, the pooling APIs discussed here are not very important.
    Instead the use and configuration of
    <literal>Spring.Aop.Target.SimplePoolTargetSource</literal> is more
    relevant. Pooling of objects can either be done Programatically or through
    the XML configuration of the Spring .NET container. Attribute support for
    pooling, similar to the ServicedComponent approach, will be available in a
    future release of Spring.NET.</para>

    <para><xref linkend="quickstarts" /> contains an example that shows the
    use of the pooling API independent of AOP functionality.</para>

    <title>Interfaces and Implementations</title>

    <para>The <literal>Spring.Pool</literal> namespace provides two simple
    interfaces to manage pools of objects. The first interface,
    <literal>IObjectPool</literal> describes how to take and put back an
    object from the pool. The second interface
    <literal>IPoolableObjectFactory</literal> is meant to be used in
    conjunction with implementations of the <literal>IObjectPool</literal>
    to provide guidance in calling various lifecycle events on the objects
    managed by the pool. These interfaces are based on the Jakarta Commons
    Pool API. <literal>Spring.Pool.Support.SimplePool</literal> is a
    default implementation of <literal>IObjectPool</literal> and
    <literal>Spring.Aop.Target.SimplePoolTargetSource</literal> is the
    implementation of <literal>IPoolableObjectFactory</literal> for use
    with AOP. The current goal of the Spring.Pool namespace is not to provide
    a one-for-one replacement of the Jakarta Commons Pool API, but rather to
    support basic object pooling needs for common AOP scenarios. Consequently,
    other interfaces and base classes available in the Jakarta package are not
    available.</para>
