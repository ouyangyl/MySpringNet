  <title>TIBCO EMS QuickStart</title>

  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The TIBCO EMS quick start application demonstrates how to use
    asynchronous messaging to implement a system for purchasing a stock. To
    purchase a stock, a client application will send a stock request message
    containing the information about the stock, i.e. ticker symbol, quantity,
    etc. The client request message will be received by the server where it
    will perform business processing on the request, for example to determine
    if the user has sufficient credit to purchase the stock or if the user is
    even allowed to make the purchase due to existing account restrictions.
    These are typically external processes as well. Usually the server
    application will persist state about the request and forward it on to an
    execute venue where the actual execution of the stock request is
    performed. In addition, market data for the stock will be sent from the
    server process to the client. The high level exchange of information is
    shown below.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Message Destinations</title>

    <para>To implement this flow using messaging the following queues and
    topics will be used. All requests from the client to the server will be
    sent on the queue named APP.STOCK.REQUEST. Responses to the requests will
    be sent from the server to the client on a queue unique to each client. In
    this example the queue name is of the form APP.STOCK.&lt;UserName&gt;, and
    more specifically is configured to be APP.STOCK.JOE. Market data does not
    need to be delivered to an individual client as many client applications
    are interested in this shared information. As such, the server will send
    market data information on a topic named APP.STOCK.MARKETDATA. The
    messaging communication between the server and the execution venue is not
    included as part of the application. An local implementation of the
    service interface that represents the execution venue is used instead of
    one based on messaging or another middleware technology. The messaging
    flow showing the queues and topics used is shown below.</para>

    <title>Messaging Infrastructure</title>

    <para>Much of this application mirrors the quickstart that is available
    with ActiveMQ and you should refer to the NMS QuickStart for the
    description on how the application in structured in terms of Gateway,
    Message Data formats, Message Handler, and Message Converters. What this
    section describeds are the specific configuration related to using TIBCO
    EMS.</para>

    <para>The implementations of the gateway interfaces inherit from Spring's
    helper class <literal>EmsGatewaySupport</literal> in order to get easy
    access to a <classname>EmsTemplate</classname> for sending. The
    implementation of the <literal>IStockService</literal> interface is shown
    below</para>

    <programlisting language="csharp">    public class EmsStockServiceGateway : EmsGatewaySupport, IStockService
    {
        private Destination defaultReplyToQueue;
        
        public Destination DefaultReplyToQueue
        {
            set { defaultReplyToQueue = value; }
        }

        public void Send(TradeRequest tradeRequest)
        {            
            EmsTemplate.ConvertAndSendWithDelegate(tradeRequest, delegate(Message message)
                                                                     {
                                                                         message.ReplyTo = defaultReplyToQueue;
                                                                         message.CorrelationID = new Guid().ToString();
                                                                         return message;
                                                                     });
        }        
    }</programlisting>

    <para>The <literal>Send</literal> method is using EmsTemplate's
    <literal>ConvertAndSendWithDelegate(object obj,
    MessagePostProcessorDelegate messagePostProcessorDelegate)</literal>
    method. The anonymous delegate allows you to modify the message
    properties, such as ReplyTo and CorrelationID after the message has been
    converted from an object but before it has been sent. The use of an
    anonymous delegate allows makes it very easy to apply any post processing
    logic to the converted message.</para>

    <para>The object definition for the
    <literal>EmsStockServiceGateway</literal> is shown below along with its
    dependent object definitions of <classname>EmsTemplate</classname> and the
    <classname>ConnectionFactory</classname>.</para>

    <para><programlisting language="myxml">  &lt;object id="ConnectionFactory" type="Spring.Messaging.Ems.Common.EmsConnectionFactory, Spring.Messaging.Ems"&gt;
    &lt;constructor-arg index="0" value="tcp://localhost:7222"/&gt;
  &lt;/object&gt;

  &lt;!-- EMS based implementation of technology neutral IStockServiceGateway --&gt;
  &lt;object name="StockServiceGateway" type="Spring.EmsQuickStart.Client.Gateways.EmsStockServiceGateway, Spring.EmsQuickStart.Client"&gt;
    &lt;property name="EmsTemplate"  ref="EmsTemplate"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="DefaultReplyToQueue"&gt;
      &lt;object type="TIBCO.EMS.Queue, TIBCO.EMS"&gt;
        &lt;constructor-arg value="APP.STOCK.JOE"/&gt;
      &lt;/object&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
  &lt;/object&gt;


  &lt;object name="EmsTemplate" type="Spring.Messaging.Ems.Core.EmsTemplate, Spring.Messaging.Ems"&gt;
    &lt;property name="ConnectionFactory" ref="ConnectionFactory"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="DefaultDestinationName" value="APP.STOCK.REQUEST"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="MessageConverter" ref="XmlMessageConverter"/&gt;
  &lt;/object&gt;</programlisting>In this example the
    <literal>Spring.Messaging.Ems.Common.EmsConnectionFactory
    </literal>connection factory was used. It would be more efficient resource
    wise to use Spring's <literal>CachingConnectionFactory</literal> wrapper
    class so that connections will not be open and closed for each message
    send as well as allowing for the caching of other intermediate EMS API
    objects such as sessions and message producers.</para>

    <para>A similar configuration is used on the server to configure the class
    <literal>Spring.EmsQuickStart.Server.Gateways.MarketDataServiceGateway
    </literal>that implements the <literal>IMarketDataService</literal>
    interface.</para>

    <para>Since the client is also a consumer of messages, on the topic
    APP.STOCK.MARKETDATA and the queue APP.STOCK.JOE (for Trader Joe!), two
    message listener containers are defined as shown below.</para>

    <programlisting language="myxml">  &lt;ems:listener-container connection-factory="ConnectionFactory"&gt;
    &lt;ems:listener ref="MessageListenerAdapter" destination="APP.STOCK.JOE" /&gt;
    &lt;ems:listener ref="MessageListenerAdapter" destination="APP.STOCK.MARKETDATA" pubsub-domain="true"/&gt;
  &lt;/ems:listener-container&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>Refer to the <link linkend="messaging">messages reference
    docs</link> for all the available attributes to configure the container
    and also the section on <link
    linkend="xsd-config-body-schemas-nms">registering the EMS schema</link>
    with Spring..</para>

    <para>On the server we define a message listener container for the queue
    APP.STOCK.REQUEST but set the concurrency property to 10 so that 10
    threads will be consuming messages from the queue.</para>

    <programlisting language="myxml">  &lt;ems:listener-container connection-factory="ConnectionFactory" concurrency="<emphasis
        role="bold">10</emphasis>"&gt;
    &lt;ems:listener ref="MessageListenerAdapter" destination="APP.STOCK.REQUEST" /&gt;
  &lt;/ems:listener-container&gt;</programlisting>

    <title>Running the application</title>

    <para>To run both the client and server make sure that you select
    'Multiple Startup Projects' within VS.NET. The GUI has a button to make a
    hardcoded trade request and show confirmation in a text box. A text area
    is used to display the market data. There is a 'Get Portfolio' button that
    is not implemented at the moment. A picture of the GUI after it has been
    running for a while and trade has been sent and responded to is shown
    below</para>
