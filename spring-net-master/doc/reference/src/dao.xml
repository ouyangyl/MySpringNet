  <title>DAO support</title>

  <section xml:id="dao-introduction">
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Spring promotes the use of data access interfaces in your
    application architecture. These interfaces encapsulate the storage and
    retrieval of data and objects specific to your business domain without
    reference to a specific persistence API. Within a layered architecture,
    the service layer is typically responsible for coordinating responses to a
    particular business request and it delegates any persistence related
    activities to objects that implement these data access interfaces. These
    objects are commonly referred to as DAOs (Data Access Objects) and the
    architectural layer as a DAL (Data Access Layer).</para>

    <para>The benefits of using DAOs in your application are increased
    portability across persistence technology and ease of testing. Testing is
    more easily facilitated because a mock or stub implementation of the data
    access interface can be easily created in a NUnit test so that service
    layer functionality can be tested without any dependency on the database.
    This is beneficial because tests that rely on the database are usually
    hard to set up and tear down and also are impractical for testing
    exceptional behavior.</para>

    <para>The Data Access Object (DAO) support in Spring is aimed at making it
    easy to work with data access technologies like ADO.NET and NHibernate in
    a standardized way. Spring provides two central pieces of functionality to
    meet this goal. The first is providing a common exception hierarchy across
    providers and the second is providing base DAOs classes that raise the
    level of abstraction when performing common ADO.NET operations. This
    allows one to switch between the aforementioned persistence technologies
    fairly easily and it also allows one to code without worrying about
    catching exceptions that are specific to each technology.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="dao-exceptions">
    <title>Consistent exception hierarchy</title>

    <para>Database exceptions in the ADO.NET API are not consistent across
    providers. The .NET 1.1 BCL did not provide a common base class for
    ADO.NET exceptions. As such you were required to handle exceptions
    specific to each provider such as
    <literal>System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException</literal> or
    <literal>System.Data.OracleClient.OracleException</literal>. The .NET
    2.0 BCL improved in this regard by introducing a common base class for
    exceptions, <literal>System.Data.Common.DbException</literal>. However
    the common DbException is not very portable either as it provides a vendor
    specific error code as the underlying piece of information as to what went
    wrong. This error code is different across providers for the same
    conceptual error, such as a violation of data integrity or providing bad
    SQL grammar.</para>

    <para>To promote writing portable and descriptive exception handling code
    Spring provides a convenient translation from technology specific
    exceptions like <literal>System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException</literal>
    or <literal>System.Data.OracleClient.OracleException</literal> to its
    own exception hierarchy with the
    <literal>Spring.Dao.DataAccessException</literal> as the root
    exception. These exceptions wrap the original exception so there is never
    any risk that one might lose any information as to what might have gone
    wrong.</para>

    <para>In addition to exceptions from ADO.NET providers, Spring can also
    wrap NHibernate-specific exceptions.. This allows one to handle most
    persistence exceptions, which are non-recoverable, only in the appropriate
    layers, without boilerplate using or catch and throw blocks, and exception
    declarations. As mentioned above, ADO.NET exceptions (including
    database-specific dialects) are also converted to the same hierarchy,
    meaning that one can perform some operations with ADO.NET within a
    consistent programming model. The above holds true for the various
    template-based versions of the ORM access framework.</para>

    <para>The exception hierarchy that Spring uses is outlined in the
    following image:</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="images/DataAccessException.gif" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>(Please note that the class hierarchy detailed in the above image
    shows only a subset of the whole, rich,
    <literal>DataAccessException</literal> hierarchy.)</para>

    <para>The exception translation functionality is in the namespace
    Spring.Data.Support and is based on the interface
    <literal>IAdoExceptionTranslator</literal> shown below.</para>

    <programlisting language="csharp">public interface IAdoExceptionTranslator
{
  DataAccessException Translate( string task, string sql, Exception exception );
}</programlisting>

    <para>The arguments to the translator are a task string providing a
    description of the task being attempted, the SQL query or update that
    caused the problem, and the 'raw' exception thrown by the ADO.NET data
    provider. The additional task and SQL arguments allow for very readable
    and clear error messages to be created when an exception occurs.</para>

    <para>A default implementation,
    <literal>ErrorCodeExceptionTranslator</literal>, is provided that uses the
    error codes defined for each data provider in the file dbproviders.xml.
    Refer to this file, an embedded resource in the Spring.Data assembly, for
    the exact mappings of error codes to Spring DataAccessExceptions.</para>

    <para>A common need is to modify the error codes that are map onto the
    exception hierarchy. There are several ways to accomplish this
    task.</para>

    <para>One approach is to override the error codes that are defined in
    <code>assembly://Spring.Data/Spring.Data.Common/dbproviders.xml</code>. By
    default, the <link
    linkend="dbprovider-dbprovider">DbProviderFactory</link> will look for
    additional metadata for the IoC container it uses internally to define and
    manage the DbProviders in a file named <literal>dbProviders.xml</literal>
    located in the root runtime directory. (You can change this location, see
    the documentation on <link lang=""
    linkend="dbprovider-dbprovider">DbProvider</link> for more information.)
    This is a standard Spring application context so all features, such as
    <link
    linkend="objects-factory-customizing-factory-postprocessors">ObjectFactoryPostProcessors</link>
    are available and will be automatically applied. Defining a <link
    linkend="objects-factory-overrideconfigurer">PropertyOverrideConfigurer</link>
    in this additional configuration file will allow for you to override
    specific property values defined in the embedded resource file. As an
    example, the additional <literal>dbProviders.xml</literal> file shown
    below will add the error code <literal>2601</literal> to the list of error
    codes that map to a
    <literal>DataIntegrityViolationException</literal>.</para>

    <para><programlisting language="myxml">&lt;objects xmlns='http://www.springframework.net'&gt;
 
  &lt;alias name='SqlServer-2.0' alias='SqlServer2005'/&gt;
 
  &lt;object name="appConfigPropertyOverride" type="Spring.Objects.Factory.Config.PropertyOverrideConfigurer, Spring.Core"&gt;
    &lt;property name="Properties"&gt;
      &lt;name-values&gt;
        &lt;add key="SqlServer2005.DbMetadata.ErrorCodes.DataIntegrityViolationCodes"
             value="544,2601,2627,8114,8115"/&gt;
      &lt;/name-values&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
  &lt;/object&gt;

&lt;/objects&gt;</programlisting>The reason to define the alias is that <link
    linkend="objects-factory-overrideconfigurer">PropertyOverrideConfigurer</link>
    assumes a period <literal>(.)</literal> as the separator to pick out the
    object name but the names of the objects in
    <literal>dbProviders.xml</literal> have periods in them (i.e.
    SqlServer-2.0 or System.Data.SqlClient). Creating an alias that has no
    periods in the name is a workaround.</para>

    <para>Another way to customize the mappings of error codes to exceptions
    is to subclass <literal>ErrorCodeExceptionTranslator</literal> and
    override the method, <literal>DataAccessException
    TranslateException(string task, string sql, string errorCode, Exception
    exception)</literal>. This will be called before referencing the metadata
    to perform exception translation. The vendor specific error code provided
    as a method argument has already been parsed out of the raw ADO.NET
    exception. If you create your own specific subclass, then you should set
    the property <literal>ExceptionTranslator</literal> on
    <literal>AdoTemplate</literal> and
    <literal>HibernateTemplate/HibernateTransactionManager</literal> to refer
    to your custom implementation (unless you are using autowiring).</para>

    <para>The third way is to write an implementation of
    <literal>IAdoExceptionTranslator</literal> and set the property
    <literal>FallbackTranslator</literal>'on
    <literal>ErrorCodeExceptionTranslator</literal>. In this case you are
    responsible for parsing our the vendor specific error code from the raw
    ADO.NET exception. As with the case of subclassing
    ErrorCodeExceptionTranslator, you will need to refer to this custom
    exception translator when using <literal>AdoTemplate</literal> or
    <literal>HibernateTemplate/HibernateTransactionManager</literal>.</para>

    <para>The ordering of the exception translation processing is as follows.
    The method TranslateException is called first, then the standard exception
    translation logic, then the FallbackTranslator.</para>

    <para>Note that you can use this API directly in your own Spring
    independent data layer. If you are using Spring's ADO.NET abstraction
    class, <literal>AdoTemplate</literal>, or
    <literal>HibernateTemplate</literal>, the converted exceptions will be
    thrown automatically. Somewhere in between these two cases is using
    Spring's declarative transaction management features in .NET 2.0 with the
    raw ADO.NET APIs and using <literal>IAdoExceptionTranslator</literal> in
    your exception handling layer (which might be implemented in AOP using
    Spring's exception translation aspect).</para>

    <para>Some of the more common data access exceptions are described here.
    Please refer to the API documentation for more details.</para>

    <title>Consistent abstract classes for DAO support</title>

    <para>To make it easier to work with a variety of data access technologies
    such as ADO.NET, NHibernate, and iBatis.NET in a consistent way, Spring
    provides a set of abstract DAO classes that one can extend. These abstract
    classes have methods for providing the data source and any other
    configuration settings that are specific to the technology one is
    currently using.</para>

        this class provides a <literal>AdoTemplate</literal> instance
        initialized from the supplied
