      <p>
Developing software applications is hard enough even with good tools and technologies. Spring provides a light-
weight solution for building enterprise-ready applications. Spring provides a consistent and transparent means
to  configure  your  application  and  integrate AOP  into  your  software. Highlights  of Spring's  functionality  are
providing declarative transaction management for your middle tier as well as a full-featured ASP.NET framework.</p>
<p>
Spring  could potentially be  a one-stop-shop  for many  areas of  enterprise  application development; however,
Spring is modular, allowing you to use just those parts of it that you need, without having to bring in the rest. You
can use just the IoC container to configure your application and use traditional ADO.NET based data access code,
but you could also choose to use just the Hibernate integration code or the ADO.NET abstraction layer. Spring
has been (and continues to be) designed to be non-intrusive, meaning dependencies on the framework itself are
generally none (or absolutely minimal, depending on the area of use).</p>
<p>

<P>The Spring.Core assembly provides an implementation of an Inversion of Control container.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Inversion of Control (IoC) containers provide a&nbsp;simple but powerful means to&nbsp;create and configure properties of objects in your application.&nbsp; These properties maybe simple types, such as strings or integers but much of the power of an IoC container comes from the ability to set properties that are references to other objects in your application, i.e. an objects dependencies.&nbsp;</P>
<P>An introductory article to IoC containers can be found in the September 2005 edition of <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/09/DesignPatterns/default.aspx">MSDN Magazine</A>.&nbsp; Links to additional introductory material on IoC containers can be found on&nbsp;the <A href="www.springframework.net">Spring.NET</A> or <A href="www.springframework.org">Spring Framework</A> web sites.</P>
<P>The design of Spring.NET's IoC container is such that your application objects configured by the IoC container almost always to not need to depend on any classes or interfaces contained in this namespace.&nbsp;</P>
<P>However, you may find it useful to reference this assembly as it contains&nbsp;some general framework style classes&nbsp; &nbsp;These range from&nbsp;<b>Spring.Expressions</b> that provides&nbsp;evaluation of object graph expressions to&nbsp;<b>Spring.Util</b> that provides various Reflection, String, and XML utility functions.</P>
<P>Inversion of Control (IoC) containers provide a non-invasive means to configure the dependency of objects in your application.&nbsp; A more detailed&nbsp;introduction to IoC containers can be found is this <A href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">article</A> by Martin Fowler which uses a simple movie search application as a means to demonstrate the IoC container.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This example&nbsp;implemented using Spring.NET's IoC is available as part of the&nbsp;the Spring.NET distribution and documented as the <A href="http://www.springframework.net/doc-latest/reference/html/quickstarts.html">MovieFinder Quickstart</A>.</P>

<P>Spring.NET's web application framework aims to increase your productivity writing ASP.NET WebForms applications. It offers a unique value proposition to creating ASP.NET applications not found in other .NET web frameworks.</P>
<P>The goal of the framework is to make it easy to write 'thin and clean' web applications. By thin, what is meant is that the WebForm's responsibility is to act as adapter between the HTML based world of the web and the oo world of your application. The application layer your web form communicates with is where the business logic resides, not in the web tier. By 'clean' what is meant that the web framework should have a good separation of concerns, leading ideally to an event-handler that does not contain any reference to UI elements. This makes it possible to test your event handler code in integration style tests. Last but not least, Spring's web framework reduces the incidental complexity of common tasks in the web tier, for example the conversion of HTML control data to object and then vice-versa after the request has been processed by the application layer.</P>

  <P>The goal of Spring's integration with distributed technologies is to adapt plain .NET objects so they can be used with a specific distributed technology. This integration is designed to be as non-intrusive as possible. If you need to expose an object to a remote process then you can define an exporter for that object. Similarly, on the client side you define an corresponding endpoint accessor. Of course, the object's methods still need to be suitable for remoting, i.e. coarse grained, to avoid making unnecessary and expensive remote calls.</P>
  <P>Since these exporters and client side endpoint accessors are defined using meta data for Spring IoC container, you can easily use dependency injection on them to set initial state and to 'wire up' the presentation tier, such as web forms, to the service layer. In addition, you may apply AOP aspects to the exported classes and/or service endpoints to apply behavior such as logging, security, or other custom behavior that may not be provided by the target distributed technology. The Spring specific terminology for this approach to object distribution is known as Portable Service Abstractions (PSA). As a result of this approach, you can decide much later in the development process the technical details of how you will distribute your objects as compared to traditional code centric approaches. Changing of the implementation is done though configuration of the IoC container and not by recompilation. Of course, you may choose to not use the IoC container to manage these objects and use the exporter and service endpoints programatically.</P>

<P>The goals of Spring's MSMQ 3.0 messaging support is to raise the level of abstraction when writing MSMQ applications.

However, 'Out-of-the-box', <CODE class=literal>System.Messaging</CODE> leaves the act of creating sophisticated multi-threaded messaging servers and clients as an infrastructure activity for the developer. Spring fills this gap by proving easy to use helper classes that makes creating an enterprise messaging application easy. These helper classes take into account the nuances of the <CODE class=literal>System.Messaging</CODE> API, such as its lack of thread-safety in many cases, the handling of so-called 'poison messages' (messages that are endlessly redelivered due to an unrecoverable exception during message processing), and combining database transactions with message transactions.

<P>Spring's approach to distributed computing has always been to promote a plain old .NET object approach or a PONO programming model. In this approach plain .NET objects are those that are devoid of any reference to a particular middleware technology.
